	<p> In my life, there are three sides of me. There is my quiet side, my gaming side and my musical/ outgoing side.<br>In my everyday life, I am the quiet person, I dont really like talking to other people I usually like keeping to myself. College has opened me up and now I want to brach out and see what I can do and make some long term friends, I definatly need those now since all of my friends have gone away to college. <br> I am an avid gamer, I have a costum PC at home specifically made for gaming with my friends. While I game, I feel that I can be more outgoing and show my goofy side, because normally I will not ever see most of those people ever again, and  it's a nice feeling. The feeling of being able to be yourself without any judgement is so peaceful.<br>Lastly I will talk about my musical and outgoing side. I have always wanted to learn musical instruments, I thought it would compensate for the fact that I didn't talk very much, I also thought it would help impressing the ladies. After long hours of procrastinating I ended up learning a few songs on piano. Long story short, it didn't work very well. I also love to sing but only a select few have ever heard me so there is not much to talk about in that realm. For my outgoing side, I am referring to the fact that I love doing things that can get me injured, for example i used to bike around, on ramps, at skateparks, you name it. This one day me and my best friend and I made a makeshift ranp out of a couple pieces of wood. I was the first person to test it out, it worked fine so we decided to make another one to land on. after a couple runs I flipped over my handlebars beacause I didnt get enough distance, I got a pretty good scar on my knee now. other than that, I have had 7 inhuries, 6 of them being head injuries. I have recieved 28 stitches, 7 staples, super glue the to the back of my head, I also have had an ongoing headache for 4 years as a result of my tinnitus.<br> So thats all you need to know about me, i hope you enjoyed.<br><br>This is what i actuall look like. </p>	<br>
