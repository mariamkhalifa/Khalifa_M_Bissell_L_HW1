		<br>I really love writing stories, drawing them and making videos. I also love reading, anime and video games.

	<p>Here is a list of my favorite things in life:</p>

	<p>I was born in Kuwait, where I lived till I was 18. Then I went to university in Egypt and worked as a child psychologist. <br>I lived there till I moved to
	Canada 7 months ago, where I decided to change my career and start a new life pursuing my creative dreams.
